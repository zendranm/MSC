\chapter{Results}
To ensure comparability of results obtained from each implemented method, all details related to network topologies and training process, except for those that are specific for analyzed method, should be unified. It is especially important in case of methods which incorporate autoencoder idea, as dimensionality of latent space, may have great impact on final results, and therefore should be kept the same for each method. Such assumptions ensure that all differences in results arise from exceptional quality of particular method.
